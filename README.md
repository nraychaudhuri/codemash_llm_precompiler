What is RAG?â€‹

[RAG](https://python.langchain.com/docs/use_cases/question_answering/) is a technique for augmenting LLM knowledge with additional, often private or real-time, data.

Large Language Models (LLMs) have knowledge up to a certain training date and can reason on various topics. To handle private or newer data, they need Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to integrate specific, updated information into their prompts.

So far, RAG applications are the most helpful outcome of the AI revolution.
